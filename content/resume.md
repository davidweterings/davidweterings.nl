# About

I'm an experienced senior software developer who likes to work on bespoke cloud projects using Terraform, AWS and whatever programming language is required 
(I like to learn new things).

I'm comfortable working in any level of a Scrum team, whether it's being a developer, designing a new system from the ground up
or taking the lead.
